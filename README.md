# adventure-game
For my year 1 second semester project, I was tasked with designing an object-oriented, text-based, adventure game.
The player must traverse through various atmospheres and fight deadly beasts in order to progress to the final level where they must defeat a boss.
Mob enemies try to defeat the player, but by traversing the landscapes and killing enemies, the player will gain a significant amount of experience and strength in order to keep on fighting!

Throughout this project, I had the chance to consolidate OOP concepts I had learnt over the semester.
Utilising GUI, I was able to create a more engaging adventure-themed decision-making game.
Coding, debugging and testing in Java developed my logic and problem-solving skills, enabling me to achieve 100% for the project!
Extra research towards new features allowed me to reach further heights - implementing a countdown feature in order to time-constrict user input significantly enhanced user experience during fights.
